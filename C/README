=========================
2. ranlip Installation Guide
=========================

Installation of ranlip can be done in two ways: as a normal user, or ideally as a
superuser. Both ways are very similar and are described bellow. INSTALLATION MUST BE
CARRIED OUT FROM THE DIRECTORY INTO WHICH THE TARBALL WAS EXTRACTED.

---------------------------
2.1 Using ranlipinstall scrip
---------------------------

Included with this distribution is the "lipinstall' script that runs "configure", "make
install" and installs include documentation as described in sections 2.1 and 2.2.
lipinstall script must be used in the following manner.

	lipinstall [ | installation_directory ]
	
So it either takes no arguments of an install directory. If no arguments are passed to
the script then it tries to install the ranlip library in /usr/local (as described in 2.2).
If an installation_directory is given then the script will try and do the install in 
the given directory ( see section 2.3 ).

------------------------------------------
2.2 Installing as Superuser (root access)
------------------------------------------

If you do not have an account with root access, go to section 2.2. Otherwise
follow the instructions bellow.

1. login as root in any shell, using the command shown below

	e.g. shell-promp$ su -

2. run lipinstall script. It will install the library and other documentation.

	e.g. shell-promp$ ./lipinstall

the above example installs the library in the default directory "/usr/local/".
The library and other files will be installed as follows:

	- library files  		"/usr/local/lib/"
	- info manual 			"/usr/local/info/"
	- *.h files			"/usr/local/include"
	- examples			"/usr/local/share/doc/ranlip.1.0/DOCS"
	- documents			"/usr/local/share/doc/ranlip.1.0/EXAMPLES"

3. at this time the library should be installed in /usr/local/lib (as
suggested by the GNU standards for libraries that are not part of the
system).

Most Linux distributions have included the /usr/local/lib path in the
/etc/ld.so.conf file, which stores all search paths the OS searches when
loading shared libraries at boot time. red hat does not do this so add it.

4. once step 3 is completed, in order not to have to restart the computer
just run /sbin/ldconfig which loads shared libraries form the path stored
in /etc/ld.so.conf. You will not have to do this again, as it gets done
automatically every time the OS boots.

5. You are ready to use ranlip. Please read linking instructions in section 4.1

-----------------------------------
2.3 Installing Without Root Access
-----------------------------------

If your account does not allow for root access, then install ranlip into your home 
directory following these instructions.

1. run lipinstall script along with the directory you want ranlip to be installed to. 

	e.g. shell-promp$ ./lipinstall /home/user_name/ranlip

the above example installs the library in the directory "/home/user_name/ranlip".
Please note that /home/user_name/ranlip is a made up directory... when you
install the library replace user_name with your actual user name, or enter a 
different director of your choosing.

The library and other files will be included as follows:

	- library files  		"/home/user_name/ranlip/lib/"
	- info manual 			"/home/user_name/ranlip/info/"
	- *.h files			"/home/user_name/ranlip/include"
	- examples			"/home/user_name/ranlip/DOCS"
	- documents			"/home/user_name/ranlip/EXAMPLES"

2. to link and compile please read section 4.2

===============
3. Info Manual
===============

This distribution comes with an info manual named "ranlip". If you have installed
the ranlip library as a root, then to access the manual just type "info ranlip" at the
promp.

	e.g. shell-promp$ info ranlip

else you are going to have to specify the directory where the ranlip.info is
located.

	e.g. shell-promp$ info /usr/local/info/ranlip

	Or in your home directory under a directory you created named "ranlip"

	e.g. shell-promp$ info $HOME/ranlip/info/ranlip


==========================
4. linking to the library
==========================

--------------------------------------------------------
4.1 linking to the library in search path (shared library)
--------------------------------------------------------

If you have installed the library in the default path /usr/local/lib and this
directory exists in /etc/ld.so.conf and loaded using /sbin/ldconfig ,then
linking and compiling your code is simple.

	1. make sure that the appropriate headers are placed in your code
	------------------------------------------------------------
	#include <ranlip.h>

	//Or if using the procedural interface

	#include <ranlipproc.h>

	------------------------------------------------------------

	2. Assume your code is in file named example.cpp. Then to compile and link use

	------------------------------------------------------------
	g++ -c example.cpp
	g++ -o example example.o -lranlip -lm

	------------------------------------------------------------

the resulting executable will be "example".

-----------------------------------------
4.2 linking to library not in search path
-----------------------------------------

If you have installed the library in a directory that is not listed in
/etc/ld.so.conf, then there are a few options:

	1. If you have installed ranlip to your home directory then use static linking.
	Example:

	a. make sure you have included the right headers
	------------------------------------------------------------
	#include "ranlip.h"

	//Or, if using the procedural interface

	#include "ranlipproc.h"

	------------------------------------------------------------

	b. Use -I option to tell the compiler where to locate header files
	and then link to libranlip.a (static library) directly.
	------------------------------------------------------------

	g++ -c example.cpp -I/home/user_name/ranlip/include

	g++ -o example -non_shared example.o /home/user_name/ranlip/lib/libranlip.a -lm
	// instead of -non_shared, some compilers require -static option, or none at all 
	
	------------------------------------------------------------

      Alternatively: 
	2. Get the system administrator to add the installation directory to
	/ect/ld.so.conf file. This could be /home/user_name/ranlip/lib.

	3. Add the library directory to the environment variable LD_LIBRAY_PATH,
	used during linking.

	4. Finally you can use the `-Wl,--rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flags. Note
	that if you do not use -Wl option then the compiler may quietly drop
	away linker flags.

-----------------------------------------
4.3 compiling the examples
-----------------------------------------

	1. change to EXAMPLES directory

	2. if you have installed ranlip into /usr/local/lib (with root access) you do not need to
  	change makefile. Otherwise edit makefile, and specify the path to the directories you
	installed ranlip to: change the lines specifying LIB_PATH  and INCLUDE_PATH,
	e.g. LIB_PATH = /home/user_name/ranlip/lib/
	INCLUDE_PATH = /home/user_name/ranlip/include/

	3. run "make" command

	If you did not install ranlip to the default directories, building of shared_example and static_example
	targets may not work. However targets static_example2 and static_example3 will compile,
	as in both case static linking is used.


=================
5. Uninstall ranlip
=================

To uninstall simply run the ranlipuninstall script at the promp.

	e.g. shell-promp$ ./ranlipuninstall

===================
6. Trouble Shootin
===================

1. Compilation:

	- depending on how the local C++ compiler has been installed on a given machine, there might be a
	need to give it some different options. To do so in the file "Makefile" look for the variable
	liblip_la_CXXFLAGS and assign it the right options.
