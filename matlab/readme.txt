This package is updated on Sep 8, 2017 to be compatible with matlab 2017a

The 64 binary Windows library was generated with MS VC2013 using mex interface.
The resulting shared libray is ramlip.mexw64

For users of other OS, the src folder contains the C/C++ source files. 
The shared library can be built by executing the script cp.m
provided that a suitable C/C++ compiled is availabe and can be accessed
through mex command.

See ranlipmatlab.pdf for further documentation. Note that references to 
ranlip.dll should be replaced with ranlip.mexw64
